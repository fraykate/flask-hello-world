## Kate Fray - Flask Hello World
This is a simple application built on Flask.

## What is it
It is an application that contains multiple routing methods to create, test, populate, teardown and display data from a postgres database.

## External Files and templates
1. It requires an additional requirements.txt file: 
* This file specifies Gunicorn to handle Flask code (and speed it up when webhosting)
* It also specifies Psycopg - the PostgreSQL database adapter
2. This was a fork of the original [flask-hello-world repo](https://github.com/render-examples/flask-hello-world) - props to the creator 
3. It was developed using the [Quickstart - Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/quickstart/#a-minimal-application)
