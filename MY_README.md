Remember when you coded up those routes for your Flask Lab. 
You were creating some code and maybe external data files. 
Now you will update your sources in the lab repository with header, function, and in code comments. 

You will produce a new readme file called MY_README.md that explains what you were doing and how you are doing it in the application code. 
Make sure to describe any external files or templates used by the application.
